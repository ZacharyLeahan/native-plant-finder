### Technologies Used

- React 18
- Axios for API calls

- Docker for containerization

## Troubleshooting

- **Application not loading**: Ensure Docker is running and port 3000 is not in use
- **API errors**: Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- **PDF export issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection (html2pdf.js loads resources from CDN)
